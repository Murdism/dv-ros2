# DV ROS2 Visualization

This is a port of the original [DV ROS Visualization project](https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/dv-ros/-/tree/master/dv_ros_visualization).
DV ROS2 Visualization project provides a node for visualization of event data. The node takes event stream as an input
and generates a colored image preview of where the events were registered. Positive / negative events are colored
with different colors on their according pixel locations.
